# atrial-fibrillation-smolk
AtrialFibrillation-Classification-SMoLK is a deep learning project designed to classify arrhythmias, specifically focusing on atrial fibrillation (Afib), using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The project leverages a neural network model with learned filters to achieve high classification accuracy across multiple classes.
